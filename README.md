# Seattle-Airbnb-Study
This project aims to take a deep dive into Airbnb data from Seattle and Predict listing prices
# Introduction
This project is part of the Udacity Nano Degree and the purpose of this project is for one to show off their technical skills, 
but more importantly for one to begin putting together a portfolio that shows one's ability to effectively communicate technical results.

## Installations
You don't need any extra libraries to run the code in this project apart from the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code is specifically designed to be compatible with Python versions 3.* and should run without any problems.

## Key Deliverables
For this Project, each student is expected to pick a data set and choose 3 questions to answer with the dataset picked.
The questions I am interested in answering are :
* How do listing prices vary for different months and availability?
* What can we deduce on the price of the listing per neighbourhood group and how does this differ per rating?
* Can one predict prices with the available data?

## File Descriptions
There is a notebook available that answers the above mentioned questions. The `.py` file should run for each cell to answer all of the above questions  and each cell also has commented lines that explains each step taken in the code. The dataset used can be accessed [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle/data).

## Results

## Licensing,Acknowledgements
I would like to thank Kaggle for providing me with the data set that was used in this project.
The data and licensing to the data is available on [This link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle/data).
